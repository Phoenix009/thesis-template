Scalable Video Coding (SVC) employs layered coding techniques to encode video,
consisting of a base layer for base video quality and enhancement layers for
improved quality. 

Traditional Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) with Advanced Video
Coding (AVC) faces suboptimal quality adaptation. SVC addresses this challenge
by enabling in-segment quality adjustments due to its layered structure,
allowing for smoother quality degradation.

A detailed study of the SVC layered coding structure shows that base-layer data
is essential for continuous playback, whereas enhancement-layer data, while
beneficial, is not strictly required. 

Our findings indicate that occasional drops in enhancement-layer data has
minimal impact on user Quality of Experience (QoE).

Building on these insights, we propose an approach that integrates SVC with a
partially reliable transport protocol to optimize video streaming. 

By prioritizing base-layer data over reliable transport channels while
opportunistically transmitting enhancement layers, our method ensures graceful
quality adaptation in response to network fluctuations.
